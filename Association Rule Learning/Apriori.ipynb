    "# Apriori\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rule Learning consists of methodology used to discover relationships between variables, one of these methods being Apriori.  Apriori stands for __A Priori__, which is latin for _from the former_. This is fitting as Apriori determines whether one circumstance is viable based on another. From a business perspective, it can be thought of as:\n",

    "> \"People who bought also bought...\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Apriori forms connections between seemingly unrelated variables in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Support:__ The % of circumstances where X is true, represented as a basic fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large support(x) = \\frac{\\text{# of X Instances}}{\\text{# of Total Instances}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Confidence:__ The % of circumstances that Y is true, when X is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large \\mathit{confidence}(X \\to Y) = \\frac{\\text{# of X & Y Instances}}{\\text{# of X Instances}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Lift:__ While applied to many machine learning models, lift in relation to the Apriori algorithm is a numerical representation of how effective a connection between two variables is. In terms of the formula, it represents how much better the chances are to get Y when choosing from datapoints containing X than choosing from all datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large \\mathit{lift}(X \\to Y) = \\frac{\\mathit{confidence}(X \\to Y)}{support(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set a minimum support and confidence; this is to prevent weak correlations from being considered and wasting computational power. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generate all subsets from the dataset that pass the minimum support qualification.\n",
    "3. Generate all rules _(connections)_ from the dataset that pass the minimum confidence qualification.\n",
    "4. Sort all rules by decreasing lift so that the most important connection can be considered first. \n",
