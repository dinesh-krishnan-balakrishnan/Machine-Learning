    "While mapping the data to a higher dimension does solve the problem of not being able to map non-linearly separable data, there is a big problem with this method: it is very compute-expensive. The computer has to make many calculations to create a function that properly maps the data. Once mapped, the computer also has to project the results back onto the original dataset. This is where the __Kernel Trick__ comes into play.\n",

    "The **Kernel Trick**, as the name implies, uses a _kernel_ to map a dataset. A *kernel* is a predefined function. Once a datapoint is passed through a *kernel function*, its resulting value will determine its classification. There are many types of kernels, a few being shown here:\n",
